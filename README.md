# InstaScraper
A simple Instagram data scraper & dashboard tool, built using Python and a web interface.

## Overview
InstaScraper allows you to scrape Instagram-related data (e.g. posts, metadata) and view / analyze it via a simple dashboard interface (HTML). It uses a cache and credential storage to persist state between runs.

## Features

- Scrape Instagram data (posts, metadata) using credentials  
- Cache scraped results in a local JSON store  
- Dashboard HTML to visualize scraped information  
- Support for credential configuration via file  
- Dependency management via `requirements.txt`  

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- Internet connection  
- Valid Instagram credentials (username / password or session cookie)  
- Basic familiarity with running Python scripts  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lightningbolt935/InstaScraper.git
   cd InstaScraper
(Optional) Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # on Linux / macOS
# or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
instagram_credentials.txt
Store your Instagram login credentials (e.g. username & password, or session cookie) in this file. The app.py script reads from it to authenticate.

instagram_cache.json
The application stores scraped data and state in this JSON file so that repeated runs do not re-fetch redundant data.

You may need to adjust how credentials are read or stored depending on Instagram’s auth mechanism or session handling.

Usage
Run the main script:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will:

Use credentials to log in or establish session.

Scrape data (if not already in cache).

Update instagram_cache.json.

Generate or update the dashboard.html file to reflect the data.

You can then open dashboard.html in your browser to visualize the scraped data.

app.py: Contains the scraping logic, authentication, data fetching and dashboard generation.

dashboard.html: The front-end HTML UI that displays the data.

instagram_cache.json: Acts as persistent storage for scraped content.

instagram_credentials.txt: To feed credentials to the app.

requirements.txt: Lists external Python libraries needed.

Caveats & Limitations
Instagram may change its API, page structure, or rate limits, which could break scraping logic.

Careful with Instagram’s terms of service and legal implications of scraping.

The credential / session handling may not be fully robust (e.g. session expiration, multi-factor auth).

The dashboard is a static HTML; dynamic updates or real-time behavior are limited.

Scraping large volumes may be slow or triggering rate limits / blocks.

Future Improvements
Add better error handling and retry logic.

Support proxies and request throttling to reduce blocking.

Make the dashboard more interactive (e.g., charts, filters, live updates).

Use asynchronous requests or optimized scraping (for faster performance).

Add tests, logging, and modularization for maintainability.

Support more Instagram endpoints (stories, followers, comments, etc.).
